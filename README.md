# AC Character Planner

Very WIP character planner for Asheron's Call.

## Previous work:

This isn't the first skill planner for AC:

- http://tkissing.github.io/AsheronsSkillz/
- http://mudzereli.github.io/asheron-skillcalc/#/

## What makes this different?

- This planner calculates actual/buffed stat/vital/skill values
- This planner intends to support more of the ways you can affect your character (like sets) <-- Very WIP

Note: I made this as a way to learn Vue.js which makes some of this reactive programming much easier.

## Development

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## Contributing

I need feedback on:

- Layout, look & feel
- Fixing/finishing some of the more "recent" ingame features like Lum/Augs/Sets/etc
- What all should get implemented

For these things and really anything else, please open Issues on this repo.
