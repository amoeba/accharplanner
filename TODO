nuxt_refactor

- Add back in Changelog page
- Add back in About page
- Create JSONSchema for builds so we can validate/etc
- Make use of Nuxt server API
  - Before I dive in too deep, check that the benefits are what I think they are
- Check out using Zod to validate JSON structures
- Is now a good time for API versioning?
- Put an image of the planner up on the main page or make the main page more visual
- Make selects and inputs the same size, height, padding, etc
- Can I figure out a way to switch between panes and tabs view?
- Fix bug in panes where the panes in the header don't collapse correctly
- Add consistent styling for links (underline by default, blue, remove underline on hover)
- Make sure most if not all fetching is done in pages not components
- Updating your account name isn't working
- From Maethor: I think when I coded mine I also had it auto-set the free racial aug when you changed your race, since you can't unlearn augs
- Fix favoriting: It's still buggy as hell
- Can I hide scrollbars in all panes? I forgot to test with a mouse hooked up in macOS.
- Guides list is showing anonymous when they aren't
- Share doesn't work on my preview deployment
- Re-do dark theme to be blue+gold
  - Maybe just add a third theme?
- Make sure planner tooltips work, I may have broken them
- SEO and OpenGraph Support
- Make it possible to download a build from the build view
- Aug sliders aren't working. They stay at zero, or appear to.
- Guides
  - Need to add support to for stages in Guides
  - Add a Guide view for just skills, no values
  - Add remainder of readonly views into Tiptap editor
  - Add support for tables and headers
  - Make sure a player can show how you'd get to like 350/450 wield (i.e., show buffed values)
- Builds
  - Local builds are sorted inverse
  - Can't paginate local or remote builds lists. The tables should paginate too so that means on the front page.
- Implement some sort of usage tracking
  - Page visits
  - Planner app loaded
  - Builds shared
  - Other telemetry?
- For front page, experiment with explainers like on https://www.val.town/
- Think about taking inspiration from https://pcpartpicker.com/list/
  - How they do saves (save can create a copy or replace an existing)
  - Build is automatically shared
