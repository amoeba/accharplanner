      The Overly-Detailed Asheron's Call Character Planner (ODACCP) was started
      as a reason to learn <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> but has
      turned into a quite useful Asheron's Call character planner.

      A big part of implementing this planner has been to understand the
      intricacies of game mechanics. Because the planner calculates so much of
      what you see in game, it has to get those mechanics implemented correctly.

      My thanks goes out to the dedicated developers who have helped me
      implement all of these mechanics including Virindi, hazridi, parad0x,
      Ripley, and Morosoity and many others I can't recall but really should
      thank.
